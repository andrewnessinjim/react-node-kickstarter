# Ultimate Hello World CRA

This project is very similar to [my previous hello world project][1]; the difference is, this project uses [create react app][2] instead of custom webpack and babel config for frontend build. Using custom config revealed serious problems when I used it in a real project. Since create react app already solves all those problems, I'm hoping to save time by not reinventing the wheel.
